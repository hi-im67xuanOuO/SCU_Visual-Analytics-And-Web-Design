The main goal is to analyze and visualize Taiwan's air quality data. Air pollution has always been an important social issue in Taiwan. Different seasons and regions have certain cycles in air quality. We analyze the correlation from various factors that may affect air quality of Taiwan, such as rainfall, wind direction, and so on.

Moreover, we build an interactive web page to present our graphs and analysis of results.
We use **Python** and **R** to process data cleaning and visualization, and **Html**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** is for setting up the webpage.
